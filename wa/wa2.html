        <p>My goals for this class is to expand my knowledge in computer language</p>
        <p>I've had experience in Programming through Information science classes. I've iterated through HTML and XML.</p>
        <p>I like to spend time crocheting, painting, and reading books</p>
        <p>A book that I'm reading right now is called <em>Talk to me</em> by TC Boyle </p>
        <p>It's about a researcher teaching a monkey how to speak and it turns into a love triangle between him, a student and <b>the monkey</b>.</p>
        <p>There is this short film about animal testing that was directed by Taika Waititi. I really like it. It's about the rabbit talking about what they go through working in a testing facility. </p>
